## **Introduction**

Everything has an expiration date so do humans. With continuous advancements in healthcare and technology, professionals can precisely predict the life span of an individual given the essential parameter. Life expectancy defines as an estimate of the average age an individual of a population group will be when they die. In other words, it is the number of years a person expects to live, which is an important indicator for population health and is frequently used for demographic analysis for countries. 

According to statistics, the average life expectancy at birth was 82.1 years in 2020 among comparable countries, which was down by 0.5 years from the previous year. According to CDCâ€™s National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), life expectancy at birth in the U.S. decreased to 77.3 years in 2020, down 1.6 years from 78.9 years in 2019. Inevitably, COVID-19 surges the decline in global life expectancy. But what are the other variables affecting the life span of individuals?
