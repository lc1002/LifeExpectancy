## Project Motivation

We all know someone who is “obsessed” with astrology or other popular way to interpret ones’s characters and predict the future. Palmistry, the practice of fortune-telling and evaluating aspects of a person’s life through the study of the palm. The association between the life line in palm reading and longevity resemblances with life expectancy, which reflects the quality of our health and physical vitality at a given time. Similarly, life expectancy, a statistical measure of the average number of years a person of a given age expect to live and the key for accessing population health. 
Unsurprisingly, life expectancy around the world has fallen dramatically, according to the 2020 death data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics, in 2020 Covid-19 resulted in an enormous drop in life expectancy and an increase in the death rate in United States. Human life span may have a maximum “absolute limit”. Health professionals calculate life expectancy at birth to better understand a country’s health over time. When analyzing life span, there are many variables that are driving the rise and fall of an individual’s life span. Aside from unforeseeable conditions, health and lives are definitely important. Through this project, we hope that useful information could be retrieve and effects on an individual’s life expectancy could be effective communicate to the audience in the hope of raising awareness.
