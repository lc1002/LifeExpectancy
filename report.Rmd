## Project Motivation

We all know someone who is “obsessed” with astrology or another popular way to interpret one’s characters and predict the future. Palmistry is the practice of fortune-telling and evaluating aspects of a person’s life through the study of the palm. The association between the lifeline in palm reading and longevity resembles life expectancy, which reflects the quality of our health and physical vitality at a given time. Similarly, life expectancy is a statistical measure of the average number of years a person of a given age expects to live and the key for accessing population health. 

Unsurprisingly, life expectancy around the world has fallen dramatically. According to the 2020 death data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics, in 2020, Covid-19 resulted in an enormous drop in life expectancy and an increase in the death rate in the United States. Human life span may have a maximum “absolute limit”. Health professionals calculate life expectancy at birth to better understand a country’s health over time. When analyzing life span, many variables are diving into the rise and fall of an individual’s life span, such as socioeconomic, genetic, and environmental factors. In order to better understand the measure of life expectancy, we will investigate via statistical methods and explore the parameters affecting the life span of individuals and how life expectancy can be estimated with regression models. Through this project, we hope that useful information could be retrieved and effects on an individual’s life expectancy could be effectively communicated to the audience in the hope of raising awareness.
