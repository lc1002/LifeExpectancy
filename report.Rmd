## **Project Motivation**

We all know someone who is “obsessed” with astrology or another popular way to interpret one’s characters and predict the future. Palmistry is the practice of fortune-telling and evaluating aspects of a person’s life through the study of the palm. The association between the lifeline in palm reading and longevity resembles life expectancy, which reflects the quality of our health and physical vitality at a given time. Similarly, life expectancy is a statistical measure of the average number of years a person of a given age expects to live and the key for accessing population health. 

Unsurprisingly, life expectancy around the world has fallen dramatically. According to the 2020 death data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics, in 2020, Covid-19 resulted in an enormous drop in life expectancy and an increase in the death rate in the United States. Human life span may have a maximum “absolute limit”. Health professionals calculate life expectancy at birth to better understand a country’s health over time. When analyzing life span, many variables are diving into the rise and fall of an individual’s life span, such as socioeconomic, genetic, and environmental factors. In order to better understand the measure of life expectancy, we will investigate via statistical methods and explore the parameters affecting the life span of individuals and how life expectancy can be estimated with regression models. Through this project, we hope that useful information could be retrieved and effects on an individual’s life expectancy could be effectively communicated to the audience in the hope of raising awareness.

## **Research Questions**

In this data science project, we analyzed the Life expectancy dataset to have a bettering understanding on the trends and effects of life expectancy and related factors. In reality, life expectancy is  affected by a variety of socioeconomic, demographic and health factors. Therefore, we would like to conduct this study to investigate and better understand the measure of life expectancy. We intend to provide an in-depth observation with an exploratory data analysis, visualizations (plots, interactive map, correlation matrix), in addition to statistical analysis and modeling. 

We want to dive into the dataset to grasp some interesting findings as well as answers to some of questions of interest. 

1. How does Infant and Adult mortality rates affect life expectancy?
2. Does Life Expectancy has a correlation with eating habits, drinking alcohol etc. 
3. What is the impact of schooling on the life expectancy of humans?
4. Does countries with higher GDP or more healthcare expenditure tends to have longer life expectancy?
5. How does a development status of a country affect average life expectancy. Does individuals living in a developed country an a better standard of living have higher average life expectancy?

Nevertheless, our ultimate goal is to determine the most significant factors which affects life expectancy to create an optimal regression model for predicting life expectancy through examining evaluation metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and R-Squared to evaluate the performance of different regression models.

## **Data**

### Data Sources


The primary dataset ([Life Expectancy (WHO)](https://www.kaggle.com/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who)) used in this project was collected from the Global Health Observatory (GHO) under The World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations website with the help of Deeksha Russell and Duan Wang. This dataset contains data related to life expectancy along with many other factors in significant categories such as health, demographic, socioeconomic, mortality, and immunization for 193 countries from year 2000-2015. 

In addition to the Life Expectancy dataset we also incorporated [country-to-continent dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/statchaitya/country-to-continent) which contains a list of all countries and continent they are located in order to better visualize the data by regions when performing exploratory analysis. We also used [World borders dataset](http://thematicmapping.org/downloads/world_borders.php) dataset to supplement our analysis for the [interactive map](interactive_map.html).

### Data Cleaning

As mentioned, our primary dataset is the life expectancy data obtained from WHO. The dataset contains 22 columns and 2938 observations with 20 predicting variables. Our initial inspection of the data showed a total of 2563 missing values. We decided to use the interpolation technique to handle these missing values using R. Most of the missing data was for variable `population`, `Hepatitis_B`, `GDP`, and alcohol, and the majority was from small countries like Tonga, Cabo Verde, Vanuatu, and etc. Thus, We approached imputation using the `MICE` package with probable data values which were drawn from a distribution designed for each missing data. The dataset contains variables such as country, year, status, life expectancy, etc. All variables were divided into categories: demographic, socioeconomic, mortality, and immunization-related factors. 

In order to have a better visualization of the data by region, we merged an external data based on countries and continents. We also created necessary dummy variables by splitting the categorical variable into two new variables. Two dummy variables were created for variable `status` such that `status_Developed` indicates the country is developed and `status_Developing` means a country is developing. In addition, when exploring the summary statistics of the variables, we realized variables `Hepatitis_B`, `Polio`, and `Diphtheria`, have a wide range between the minimum value and the 1st Quartile, which we decided to manipulated these variables into categorical variables, with 2 value: “Under 80% Covered” being Low and “Covered by 80% or More” being High (e.g., `polio_high` and `polio_low`). For each dummy variable created, we used `1` to represent the presence of the variable for and `0` to indicate the absence of that variable  (e.g., in dummy variable `status_Developng`, the value `1` means developing and the value `0` represents developed). By converting these variables, we hope to get a better view of the immunization impact on life expectancy.

## **Analyses**

### Exploratory Analysis

Initial data investigation was performed to discover the patterns of our data, detect anomalies, and test correlations between variables using tables and graphic visualizations. Specifically, we first examined the distribution and global trend of life expectancy, both by country and continent.
Then, we looked at the distribution of a country’s development status among continents. After realizing there might be potential linkage between development status and life expectancy, we also explored the correlation between development status and life expectancy using violin plots. Finally, we analyzed the correlation between life expectancy, GDP per capita, and population.

### Statistical analysis

In order to further investigate the variables and potential factors correlated with individual’s life expectancy, hypothesis testing was performed in this page. 

**Development Status:** A two-sample t-test was conducted to test the difference between the mean life expectancy of developing countries and developed countries. The results prove that the life expectancy of developed countries is greater than developing countries.

**Income composition of resources (HDI):** A scatter plot was used to visualize the relationship between mean HDI and mean life expectancy. Indeed, it shows a significant positive correlation between life expectancy and HDI.

**Infant deaths and Under-five deaths:** We compared the proportions of the `infant deaths` and `under-five` using the two-proportions z-test, and the results show no difference in the two independent proportions.

**Alcohol:** Using scatter plots, we explored the correlation between alcohol consumption and life expectancy. We also explore the correlation between adult mortality and alcohol consumption. The scatter plots demonstrate that alcohol consumption has a positive correlation with life expectancy and a negative correlation with adult mortality.

**Correlation between immunization and other health-related factors:** A t-test was performed to examine the differences between the proportion of high life expectancy countries’ government expenditure on healthcare and the proportion of low life expectancy countries’ government expenditure on healthcare. The results show that countries with low life expectancy spend less of their government expenditure on health.

**Correlation between socioeconomic and behavioral factors:** Linear regression was conducted based on socioeconomic and behavioral factors such as `alcohol`, `percent_exp`, `total_exp`, `bmi`, `population`, `HDI`, `schooling`, and `GDP`,  to have a deeper understanding on how these factors influence the life expectancy of a country. Based on the resulted model, we notice that `total_exp` and `population` are insignificant in predicting life expectancy. We also notice that many variables, such as `percent_exp` and `gdp` are highly correlated with each other in this model. In addition, a t-test was performed to test the impact of education level on life expectancy. The results of the t-test prove that the average number of years in school has a significant impact on life expectancy.

### Modeling

To understand the relationship between life expectancy and variables that might affect an individual’s life span, we have built a predictive model for life expectancy using existing data. First we examined the correlation between life expectancy and potential predictors in our dataset. Using **correlation matrix**, we have identified multiple predictor variables that are highly correlated to each other. This concerns us that the variables in our dataset might not provide unique or independent information in the regression models. Therefore, in addition to multiple linear regression models, we also applied regularization method to resolve multicollinearity issues. Below is a summary of the models we proposed based on prior research and automated model selection:

<br>

#### *Multiple linear regression models:*

**Research Model:**

$Life \ Expectancy = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}*(Developed \ Status) +         \beta_{2}*(Percent \ Expenditure) + \beta_{3}*(HDI)$
$+ \beta_{4}*(Adult \ Mortality) + \beta_{5}*(Infant \ Deaths) + \beta_{6}*(Schooling) + \beta_{7}*(HIV/AIDS)$
$+ \beta_{8}*(GDP * Percent \ Expenditure)$

<br>

**Stepwise Model:**

$Life \ Expectancy = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}*(Developed \ Status) + \beta_{2}*(Adult \ Mortality) + \beta_{3}*(BMI)$
$+ \beta_{4}*(High \ Polio) + \beta_{5}*(High \ Diphtheria) + \beta_{6}*(HIV/AIDS) + \beta_{7}*(GDP)$ 
$+ \beta_{8}*(Prevalence \ of \ thinness 10-19) + \beta_{9}*(HDI) + \beta_{10}*(Schooling)$

<br>

**Best Subsets Model:**

$Life \ Expectancy = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}*(Adult \ Mortality) + \beta_{2}*(Under-five\ Deaths) + \beta_{3}*(High \ Polio)$
$+ \beta_{4}*(HIV/AIDS) + \beta_{5}*(GDP) + \beta_{6}*(HDI) + \beta_{7}*(Schooling)$

<br>

#### *Regularized regression models:*

**Ridge Model (Mathematical Equation):**

$\sum_{i=1}^n{(y_{i} - \beta_{0} - \sum_{j=1}^{p}{\beta_{i}x_{ij}})^2} + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^{p}{\beta_{j}^2} = RSS + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^{p}{\beta_{j}^2}$

<br>

**Lasso Model (Mathematical Equation):**

$\sum_{i=1}^n{(y_{i} - \beta_{0} - \sum_{j=1}^{p}{\beta_{i}x_{ij}})^2} + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^{p}{|\beta_{j}|} = RSS + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^{p}{|\beta_{j}|}$

<br>

Next, we evaluated and compared the performance of each of the models with metrics of evaluation (i.e., root mean square deviation (RMSE), R-squared (R^2), and mean absolute error (MAE) ) using cross-validation. Based on the results, we concluded that the model generated from Lasso Regression is the best-fitted model among the five candidate models.

## **Key Findings**

*	The world’s life expectancy gradually increase from 2000 to 2015.
*	Majority of the people across the world have a life expectancy between 65 and 80 years.
* Sub-Saharan African countries have the lowest life expectancy while countries in Europe, North America, and Australia are among the highest.
* Japan has the world’s highest life expectancy of 82.54 years, while Sierra Leone has the world’s lowest life expectancy of 46.11 years.
* There was a dramatic increase in the life expectancy of Africa in the 20th century, but the life expectancy gap between Africa and other continents remains enormous.
*	Africa is the only continent that consists of only developing countries.
* On average, individuals living in developed countries tend to live almost a decade longer than individuals living in developing countries. 
* Generally, countries with higher life expectancy spend a higher proportion of their resources on human development (i.e., health, education, and standard of living).
* Countries with higher GDP per capita (i.e., a measure of a country’s economic output per person) tend to have a higher life expectancy.
* Alcohol consumption has a positive correlation with life expectancy, while it has a negative correlation with adult mortality.
* Countries with high life expectancy generally spend a higher proportion of their government expenditure on healthcare than countries with low life expectancy.
* Individuals with high education levels usually have a higher life expectancy than those with low education levels.
* Mortality factors (i.e., `under-five deaths`,`infant deaths`,`Adult mortality` and `hiv_aids`) and socioeconomic factors (i.e., `Schooling`and `HDI`) are the most important factors in predicting life expectancy worldwide.
