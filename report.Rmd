## Project Motivation

We all know someone who is “obsessed” with astrology or another popular way to interpret one’s characters and predict the future. Palmistry is the practice of fortune-telling and evaluating aspects of a person’s life through the study of the palm. The association between the lifeline in palm reading and longevity resembles life expectancy, which reflects the quality of our health and physical vitality at a given time. Similarly, life expectancy is a statistical measure of the average number of years a person of a given age expects to live and the key for accessing population health. 

Unsurprisingly, life expectancy around the world has fallen dramatically. According to the 2020 death data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics, in 2020, Covid-19 resulted in an enormous drop in life expectancy and an increase in the death rate in the United States. Human life span may have a maximum “absolute limit”. Health professionals calculate life expectancy at birth to better understand a country’s health over time. When analyzing life span, many variables are diving into the rise and fall of an individual’s life span, such as socioeconomic, genetic, and environmental factors. In order to better understand the measure of life expectancy, we will investigate via statistical methods and explore the parameters affecting the life span of individuals and how life expectancy can be estimated with regression models. Through this project, we hope that useful information could be retrieved and effects on an individual’s life expectancy could be effectively communicated to the audience in the hope of raising awareness.

## Research Questions

In this data science project, we analyzed the Life expectancy dataset to have a bettering understanding on the trends and effects of life expectancy and related factors. In reality, life expectancy is  affected by a variety of socioeconomic, demographic and health factors. Therefore, we would like to conduct this study to investigate and better understand the measure of life expectancy. We intend to provide an in-depth observation with an exploratory data analysis, visualizations (plots, interactive map, correlation matrix), in addition to statistical analysis and modeling. 

We want to dive into the dataset to grasp some interesting findings as well as answers to some of questions of interest. 

1. How does Infant and Adult mortality rates affect life expectancy?
2. Does Life Expectancy has a correlation with eating habits, drinking alcohol etc. 
3. What is the impact of schooling on the life expectancy of humans?
4. Does countries with higher GDP or more healthcare expenditure tends to have longer life expectancy?
5. How does a development status of a country affect average life expectancy. Does individuals living in a developed country an a better standard of living have higher average life expectancy?

Nevertheless, our ultimate goal is to determine the most significant factors which affects life expectancy to create an optimal regression model for predicting life expectancy through examining evaluation metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and R-Squared to evaluate the performance of different regression models.

## Data

### Data Sources


The primary dataset ([Life Expectancy (WHO)](https://www.kaggle.com/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who)) used in this project was collected from the Global Health Observatory (GHO) under The World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations website with the help of Deeksha Russell and Duan Wang. This dataset contains data related to life expectancy along with many other factors in significant categories such as health, demographic, socioeconomic, mortality, and immunization for 193 countries from year 2000-2015. 

In addition to the Life Expectancy dataset we also incorporated [country-to-continent dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/statchaitya/country-to-continent) which contains a list of all countries and continent they are located in order to better visualize the data by regions when performing exploratory analysis. We also used [World borders dataset](http://thematicmapping.org/downloads/world_borders.php) dataset to supplement our analysis for the [interactive map](interactive_map.html).
